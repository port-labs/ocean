"""
Utilize this client for all outbound integration requests to the third-party application. It functions as a wrapper
around the httpx.AsyncClient, incorporating retry logic at the transport layer for handling retries on 5xx errors and
connection errors.

The client is instantiated lazily, only coming into existence upon its initial access. It should not be closed when in
use, as it operates as a singleton shared across all events in the thread. It also takes care of recreating the client
in scenarios such as the creation of a new event loop, such as when initiating a new thread.
