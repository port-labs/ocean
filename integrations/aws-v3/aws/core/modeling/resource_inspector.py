class ResourceInspector[ResourceModelT: ResourceModel[Any]]:
    """
    Inspects AWS resources by executing actions and building resource models.

    This class orchestrates the execution of multiple `Action` and `BatchAction` implementations
    (as defined in the provided `ActionMap`) for given resource identifiers. It supports both
    single resource inspection and batch processing of multiple resources concurrently.

    The class uses a builder pattern to construct strongly-typed resource models from action
    results, automatically handling metadata like account ID and region.

    Type Parameters:
        ResourceModelT: A subclass of `ResourceModel` representing the resource type.

    Args:
        client: The AWS client instance used by actions to interact with AWS services.
        actions_map: An `ActionMap` that provides the set of actions to execute.
        model_factory: A callable that returns a new instance of the resource model.
        account_id: The AWS account ID for this resource (required).
        region: The AWS region for this resource (required).

    Example:
        # Single resource inspection
        inspector = ResourceInspector(client, actions_map, MyResourceModel, "123456789", "us-east-1")
        resource = await inspector.inspect("resource-name", include=["GetBucketTaggingAction"])

        # Batch resource inspection
        resources = await inspector.inspect_batch(["bucket1", "bucket2"], include=["GetBucketTaggingAction"])
