## 0.1.1-dev (2025-07-16)


### Bug Fixes

- Patch `ResyncStrategyFactory.create` in single-account and multi-account session tests to ensure full test isolation. This fixes test flakiness caused by reliance on global state and real factory logic in `TestGetAllAccountSessions` (in `test_session_factory.py`).


## 0.1.0-dev (2025-07-09)


### Features

- Introduced support for both multi-account and single-account resync strategies.
- Enabled authentication using static credentials and IAM roles.
- Removed the requirement for organization/root account-level permissions.
