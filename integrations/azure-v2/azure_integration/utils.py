    """
    Constructs a KQL `where` clause for filtering based on resource group tags.

    This function builds a KQL filter clause that can be appended to a query.
    It supports both inclusion and exclusion criteria for tags.

    - Included tags are combined with AND logic (all must be present).
    - Excluded tags are combined with OR logic inside a NOT clause (none should be present).
    - If both included and excluded filters are provided, they are combined with AND.

    Args:
        filters: A ResourceGroupTagFilters object containing `included` and `excluded` tag dictionaries.
        tag_key_name: The name of the tag column/field in the KQL query. Defaults to "tags".

    Returns:
        A string representing the KQL `| where ...` clause, or an empty string if no filters are provided.
