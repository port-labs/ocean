    A list implementation that takes advantage of the patch implemented in this file.
    There are two ways to use this method:
    1. Pass the resource type and api version to the method, and it will query the resource provider
        This is suitable for resource types that are not sub resources (Microsoft.Sql/servers) and can be queried in a
        subscription scope.
        example:
        resource_type = "Microsoft.storage/storageAccounts"
        api_version = "2023-01-01"

        Those params will result the following request:
        (https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/{resourceType}?api-version={apiVersion})

    2. Pass the resource url and api version to the method, and it will query the resource provider
        This is suitable for resource types that are sub resources (Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases) and can be queried
        in a resource scope, which means that the resource id of the parent resource is required.
        example:
        Lets say we want to list all containers in a storage account.
        The containers resource type is "Microsoft.storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers"
        api_version = "2023-01-01"
        resource_url = "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/blobServices/{blobService}/containers"
        The resource url is the resource id of the parent resource + the resource type of the sub resource.
        The resource url can be obtained by querying the parent resource and getting the id property from the response.

        Those params will result the following request:
        (https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/blobServices/{blobService}/containers?api-version={apiVersion})
