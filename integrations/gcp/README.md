# Google Cloud Platform integration

An integration used to import gcp resources into Port.

## Install & use the integration Locally

### Create a service account with the following permissions

**IMPORTANT- These can be granted at a Project/Folder/Organization Level, and the integration will digest all resources of all projects with these permissions.**

- cloudasset.assets.exportResource
- cloudasset.assets.listCloudAssetFeeds
- cloudasset.assets.listResource
- cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources
- cloudasset.feeds.create
- cloudasset.feeds.list
- pubsub.topics.list
- pubsub.topics.get
- resourcemanager.projects.get
- resourcemanager.projects.list
- resourcemanager.folders.get
- resourcemanager.folders.list

#### Suggested way of achieving this

1. Create a service account in a **project**
2. Create a role in the scope you want the integration to run (= Make sure you selected the right resource in the top left corner).
3. Grant the role to the service account (can be done via the Manage Resources in IAM)

### Real time requirements

1. Create a pubsub topic in a **project**
2. Create a subscription connected to this topic:
    1. Delivery type: PUSH
        1. Insert the url to the ocean app on this format: `https://<your-url>/integration/events`
        2. You can use ngrok as a local ingress
3. Create Assets feed pointing to this topic:

    ```
    gcloud asset feeds create <FEED_ID>
    	--pubsub-topic=<your_pubsub_topic>
    	--asset-types=<ASSET_TYPES>
    	--content-type=resource
    	--condition-expression=<CONDITION_EXPRESSION>
    	<--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID>
    ```

    - **ASSETS_FEED_TOPIC_NAME** - The name of the topic created for real-time events. The format is: `projects/<your-project-id>/topics/<your-topic-name>`
    - **ASSET_TYPES** - Comma separated list of the types you want to have real-time events for. The types can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types . For example, if I want to fetch real-time events for buckets, VM instances and subscriptions, the ASSETS_FEED_ASSETS_TYPES should be:
        - `[storage.googleapis.com/Bucket,compute.googleapis.com/Instance,pubsub.googleapis.com/Subscription]`
    - **FOLDER/ORGANIZATION/PROJECT**  - This depends on what resolution you want the real time events for. **NOTICE that for each unique folder/project you’ll have to create another topic+subscription+feed.**
    - **CONDITION_EXPRESSION** - Quote surrounded query that controls what types of events create a feed event. For more information: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/monitoring-asset-changes-with-condition
        - Suggestion: `"'<YOUR PROJECT/FOLDER/ORGANIZATION ID>' in temporal_asset.asset.ancestors"`

### Starting up Ocean

1. Use service account’s permissions
    1. Create a key from the Service-account window (this will download a json file)
    2. export the location of this file in an environment variable:
        1. `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account_file.json`
2. Export Port’s credentials
    1. `export PORT_CLIENT_ID=<your_port_client_id>`
    2. `export PORT_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_port_client_secret>`
3. Run Ocean!
    1. clone the Ocean repo https://github.com/port-labs/ocean
    2. `cd integrations/gcp`
    3. `ocean sail -l DEBUG`

### Known limitations

- Quoting the GCP docs https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/monitoring-asset-changes#limitations:
    - *It can take up to 10 minutes for any feed creation, update, or deletion to take effect.*
- All of the resource delays as the are brought here: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types
