## 0.1.55 (2024-09-12)


### Improvements

- Bumped ocean version to ^0.10.10 (#1)


## 0.1.54 (2024-09-06)


### Bug Fixes

- Added an alternative key `project_id` for retrieving the quota project id, preventing failure in identifying the associated GCP quota project when `quota_project_id` isn't present in configuration.
- Fixed bug causing failure in retrieving cloud asset quota from GCP.


## 0.1.53 (2024-09-05)


### Improvements

- Bumped ocean version to ^0.10.9 (#1)


## 0.1.52 (2024-09-04)


### Improvements

- Bumped ocean version to ^0.10.8 (#1)


## 0.1.51 (2024-09-04)


### Improvements

- Improved user experience when using GCP Quotas- Added validation and used environmental variables in order to get the information the integration needs to get the project + quota of that project.


## 0.1.50 (2024-09-01)


### Improvements

- Introduced AsyncGeneratorRetry, a custom retry mechanism designed to handle resource retrieval retries instead of individual page retries. This change addresses the recurring DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors that occurred with GCP's AsyncRetry which works for page-based retries, significantly improving reliability in GCP integrations.
- Implemented a sophisticated rate limiting system based on quota levels, allowing for precise control over request limits per project, per service, and per quota.
- Added a `searchAllResourcesPerMinuteQuota` integration config for controlling the rate limit quota should the integration fail to query quota from GCP as stated in the last point. Default is 400
