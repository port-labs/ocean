# ⚡️ Getting Started

This guide introduces you to the Ocean framework used to develop integrations for Port. It is a hands-on walkthrough that will help you build your first integration — a simplified version of the Jira integration that ingests projects and issues from a Jira instance into Port.

:::note Port's Jira Integration
Please note that Port offers a fully featured [Jira integration](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/project-management/jira/). This is only a simplified version to help you understand the basics of developing an integration using the Ocean framework.

:::

By the end of this guide, you will have a working integration that you can run locally and test. You will be able to:

- Understand the structure of an Ocean integration
- Develop a simple integration using the Ocean framework
- Run and test your integration locally


## Requirements
This guide assumes:
- You have Python 3.12 installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- You are familiar with the basics of Python programming and have a basic understanding of how to use the command line.


:::info Source Code
You can find the source code for the integration in the [Jira integration directory on GitHub](https://github.com/port-labs/ocean/tree/main/integrations/jira)
