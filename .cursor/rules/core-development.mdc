   - Create new directories when needed
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Organize code logically

3. Testing Requirements
   - Write unit tests for all changes
   - Include integration tests
   - Test edge cases
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Use pytest effectively

4. Documentation

    - Keep interfaces simple
    - Avoid over-engineering
    - Consider future use cases

11. CI/CD Integration
    - Add GitHub CI checks
    - Implement pre-commit hooks
    - Add linting checks
    - Include performance tests

12. Changelog Management
    - Document all changes
    - Include version numbers
    - Describe new features
    - Note breaking changes
